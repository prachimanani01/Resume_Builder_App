## `Resume Builder App`

The Resume Builder App is a project created using the Flutter framework as a study tool to explore and practice building complete user interfaces in Flutter. This app demonstrates how a user-friendly and professional resume builder can be designed for mobile devices, complete with customizable sections for personal information, education, work experience, skills, and other key resume components.


This app is crafted with the goal of helping developers understand the intricacies of UI design in Flutter, from handling multiple forms to managing layouts and state efficiently.
